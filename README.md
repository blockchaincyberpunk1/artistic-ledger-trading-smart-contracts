# Artistic Ledger Trading Platform Smart Contracts

## Introduction
This repository contains smart contracts for the Artistic Ledger Trading Platform, a decentralized application (dApp) facilitating the buying, selling, and auctioning of artworks. These contracts are developed using Solidity and leverage OpenZeppelin libraries for secure and efficient functionality.

### Contracts in Progress
- **AccessControl.sol**: Manages permissions within the platform, such as admin rights and validator roles.
- **ArtTrade.sol**: Handles the trade of artworks including buying, selling, and auctioning.
- **ArtworkRegistry.sol**: Registers, verifies, and retrieves artworks' metadata.
- **ArtworkValidation.sol**: Enables third-party validators to authenticate artworks.
- **Counters.sol**: Provides a counter for tracking IDs and contract interactions.
- **MarketplaceFees.sol**: Manages the collection of marketplace fees for transactions.
- **Ownership.sol**: Tracks ownership and provenance of artworks.
- **PaymentSplitter.sol**: Facilitates proportional distribution of payments among multiple payees.
- **RoyaltyManagement.sol**: Manages and distributes royalties to artists for secondary sales.

## Usage
The development of these contracts is ongoing. Once completed, they will be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to power the Artistic Ledger Trading Platform. Stay tuned for updates on functionality and deployment instructions.

### Important Notes
- Make sure to review the code thoroughly and perform security audits before deploying these contracts in a production environment.
- Collaborations and contributions to the development of these contracts are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests or raise issues for improvements and bug fixes.
